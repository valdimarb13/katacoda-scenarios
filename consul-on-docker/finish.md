In this tutorial you have learned how to setup a multi-node Consul cluster using Docker containers. This is not a production setup but is more to help understand how Docker concepts work and how they can be used to setup Consul quickly and with a lot of the features available as they would be in a more robust, production environment. This is useful to understand the concepts of Docker as well as Consul and helps in aiding faster, more mature development.
